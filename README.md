# izzy(Bella)

An ecommerce marketplace inspired by Depop and Grailed.

Includes authentication, account and store setup, creating products, search, filters, product sort, shopping carts, checkout, payment, shipping, orders and refunds.

It is still incomplete in some parts, such as the forgot password functionality and reviews/ratings, but the core functionality is complete and should work without a hitch.

If you would like an account to test it out:

Seller Account:

- bella@acme.ca
- password

Buyer Account:

- saivamsi@acme.ca
- password
- At checkout enter 4242 4242 4242 4242 as your card number and fill the rest however you like. This will result in a successful transaction. For more scenarios please visit https://stripe.com/docs/testing.

Or feel free to create your own accounts and post/buy some products; and let me know if you run into anything.

Stack:

- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- NextJS
